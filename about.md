Hi, I’m Jojy Saju Joseph — a creative technologist and immersive experience designer passionate about blending design, interactivity, and technology to craft meaningful digital experiences.

Currently pursuing my Master’s in Interaction and Experience Design at the University of Limerick, I bring together a strong technical foundation in C#, C++, Unity3D, and Unreal Engine with a deep curiosity for human-centered design.

Over the past few years, I’ve worked on projects that merge virtual reality, mixed reality, and interactive systems — from developing a full-scale Oculus training simulator at Travancore Analytics, to creating immersive AR/VR experiences for brands and entertainment at PerfectFit Systems and Parcus Interactive.

I love pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with emerging technology — whether it’s prototyping futuristic interfaces, designing 3D interactions, or exploring the intersection of art and computation.

When I’m not experimenting with code or 3D worlds, you’ll find me exploring design trends, building side projects, or traveling to find inspiration in new cultures and experiences.
