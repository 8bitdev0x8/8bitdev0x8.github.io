## Featured Projects

### Li-Fi (Light Fidelity)
Li-Fi is a wireless communication technology that uses LED light instead of radio waves to transmit data. It offers much faster speeds than Wi-Fi, is more secure since light cannot pass through walls, and is ideal for use in places like hospitals and airplanes. However, it requires line of sight and only works where light is available, making it less flexible than Wi-Fi.

### SerialPilot
SerialPilot is an RC vehicle controlled through a serial communication interface, allowing commands to be sent from a computer or microcontroller directly to the RC system. It demonstrates how data transmitted over UART can be used to steer, accelerate, and manage remote-controlled vehicles, offering a simple yet effective way to explore serial-based control systems.
